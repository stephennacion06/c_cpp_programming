## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Compiler Support**: GCC, Clang, or MSVC
- **Build System**: CMake 3.15 or higher
- **C Standard**: C11 or later
- **C++ Standard**: C++17 or later

### Building Examples

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build all examples
cmake --build .

# Or build specific target
cmake --build . --target example_name
```

## 📖 Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with `c/basics/` - Learn C fundamentals
2. Explore `c/data-structures/` - Understand core data structures
3. Practice with `projects/beginner/` - Apply your knowledge
4. Move to `cpp/basics/` - Transition to C++

### For Intermediate Programmers
1. Review `cpp/oop/` and `cpp/stl/` - Master C++ fundamentals
2. Study `algorithms/` - Implement common algorithms
3. Explore `cpp/modern-cpp/` - Learn modern C++ features
4. Tackle `projects/intermediate/` - Build real applications
